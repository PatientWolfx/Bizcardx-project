os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True' explain this code

Explanation:
The code os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True' sets an environment variable within the Python script using the os module. 
This particular environment variable, KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK, is related to the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), which is used 
for optimized mathematical computations in some Python libraries like NumPy.

Explanation:

os.environ: This is a dictionary-like object in the os module that represents the environment variables of the current process.

'KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK': This is the name of the environment variable being set.

='True': This sets the value of the environment variable to the string "True".

Explanation of the Environment Variable (KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK):

	The Intel MKL library has an optimization feature where it can parallelize certain computations. However, in some cases, 
when multiple libraries in the same process use MKL, conflicts might arise.Setting KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK to 'True' allows 
multiple copies of the MKL library to coexist in the same process. This can be useful in scenarios where different parts 
of the code or different libraries use MKL independently.The environment variable essentially tells MKL that it's 
acceptable to have duplicate copies of the library in the process.

Note: 
	This workaround is often used when dealing with certain compatibility issues, especially in environments where multiple 
libraries or components might be using MKL independently. However, it's important to understand the implications and use 
it judiciously, as it might not be a solution for all cases.
