
File Writing:
with open(os.path.join(r"C:\Users\Enigma\Streamlit\Projects\BizCardX\uploaded cards", uploaded_card.name), "wb") as f:

where, 
1.This line opens a file for writing in binary mode ("wb").
2.The file path is constructed using os.path.join to join the directory path and the name of the uploaded file (uploaded_card.name).
3.The r prefix before the string indicates a raw string, which is often used to specify file paths in Windows without interpreting 
backslashes as escape characters.
4.The with statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after writing.

Writing Content to File:
f.write(uploaded_card.getbuffer())

where, 
1.This line writes the contents of the uploaded_card to the file. The getbuffer() method is used to retrieve the buffer 
containing the contents of the uploaded card.

Buffer:
    1.In an operating system, a buffer is a region of memory that temporarily stores data while it's being transferred 
from one place to another. This process is called buffering. 
    2.Data is usually stored in a buffer when it's retrieved from an input device, such as a keyboard, or just before 
it's sent to an output device, such as a printer. 
    3.In video streaming, buffering helps videos start playing before the entire video is loaded. 
It also allows pre-loaded content to continue streaming even when a connection is briefly interrupted.
